# Build Essentials

Basic Docker image providing some useful stuff for C/C++ and Ruby development.

It's based on the [ruby:2.6-stretch](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/) image, and includes useful utilities like [Valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org), [CMake](https://cmake.org), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and [Ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling).

Additionally, some sweet shell aliases are included!
